# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL
1. Loading data into a database. Ex: CREATE, UPDATE, ALTER TABLE
2. Extracting data from a SQL database Ex: SELECT
3. Cleaning, transforming and analyzing data. USING FILTERS:  WHERE, CASE etc
4. Quality Assurance for maintaining the quality and reliability of Data. Ex checking for null values 


## Project/Goals
1. Loading data into a database
2. Extracting data from a SQL database

## Challenges 
Data Loading Challenge: Overcoming data loading obstacles was a significant hurdle.
Data Cleaning Complexity: Addressing data issues encompassed fixing data types, missing values, structural problems, and more.
Data Understanding and Interpretation: Uncovering meaningful insights from the data was a crucial step.
Handling Missing Values and Data Types: Deciding how to manage missing values, particularly challenging data types like time.
Time-Related Data Complexity: Navigating time-related data complexities added to the project's challenges

## Future Goals
Utilizing CASE statements enables dynamic data transformation and simplifies conditional logic.
Implementing subqueries strategically can break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
Window functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER) provide valuable context and analysis within result sets.
Using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses helps summarize data and filter results efficiently.
Regularly reviewing query execution plans can reveal optimization opportunities for better performance.
Exploring advanced techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) simplifies complex queries and enhances readability.
